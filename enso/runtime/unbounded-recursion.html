<p>The JVM (and hence, GraalVM) do not have support for segmented stacks, and hence
do not allow for computation of unbounded recursion - if you make too many
recursive function calls you can cause your stack to overflow. Quite obviously,
this is a big problem for a functional language where recursion is the primary
construct for looping.</p>

<p>There are two main categories of solution for working with unbounded recursion:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Segmented Stacks:</strong> If you have the ability to allocate stacks on the heap
you can allocate the stack in segments as it grows, meaning that the upper
limit on the size of your stack is</li>
  <li><strong>Continuation Passing Style (CPS):</strong> A program in CPS is one in which the
flow of control is passed explicitly as a function of one argument (the
continuation). The significant benefit of this is that it means that all calls
are made in tail position, and hence no new stack frame needs to be allocated.</li>
</ul>

<p>This document contains the details of designs and experiments for allowing the
use of unbounded recursion in Enso on GraalVM.</p>

<h2 id="a-baseline">A Baseline</h2>

<p>In an ideal world, weâd like the performance of Ensoâs recursive calls to
approximate that of Haskell, which can be made to have fairly optimal
performance for a functional language. Basic measurements for a Haskell program
that sums the numbers up to 1 million are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Non-TCO:</strong> 20-25 ms/op</li>
  <li><strong>TCO:</strong> 0.8-1 ms/op</li>
</ul>

<p>All benchmarks in the sections below are written in pure Java rather than in
Enso itself. This is to allow us to estimate the maximum theoretical performance
possible when executing on the JVM. They have been run on GraalVM 19.1.0, and
perform the same summation of integers. They have a variable threshold, listed
in the results as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputSize</code>.</p>

<h2 id="emulating-stack-segmentation-with-threads">Emulating Stack Segmentation with Threads</h2>

<p>As each new thread has its own stack, we can exploit this to emulate the notion
of split stacks as used in many functional programming languages. The basic idea
is to work out when youâre about to run out of stack space,</p>

<h3 id="when-to-spawn-a-thread">When to Spawn a Thread</h3>

<p>One of the main problems with this approach is that you want to make as much use
out of the stack for a given thread as possible. However, it is very difficult
to get an accurate idea of when a stack may be <em>about</em> to overflow. There are
two main approaches:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Conservative Counting:</strong> You can explicitly maintain a counter that records
the depth of your call stack.</li>
  <li><strong>Catching the Overflow:</strong> When a thread on the JVM overflows, it throws a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StackOverflowError</code>, thus giving information as to when youâve run out of
stack space.</li>
</ul>

<p>It may at first be apparent that you can rely on some other details of how JVM
stacks are implemented, but the JVM spec is very loose with regards to what it
permits as a valid stack implementation. This means that from a specification
perspective there is very little that could actually be relied upon.</p>

<h3 id="conservative-counting">Conservative Counting</h3>

<p>A naive and obvious solution is to maintain a counter that tracks the depth of
your call stack. This would allow you to make a conservative estimate of the
amount of stack you have remaining, and spawn a new thread at some threshold.</p>

<p>Of course, the main issue with this is that the stacks you have available become
significantly under-utilised as the threshold has to be set such that overflow
is impossible.</p>

<p>We did some brief testing to experiment with the âdepth limitâ to find a rough
estimate for how much utilisation we could get out of the thread stacks before
they overflowed. In practice this seemed to be around 2000, though some runs
could have it set higher. Using this value gave the following results.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Benchmark                 (inputSize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units
Main.testCountedExecutor          100  avgt    5    0.001 Â±  0.001  ms/op
Main.testCountedExecutor         1000  avgt    5    0.008 Â±  0.004  ms/op
Main.testCountedExecutor        10000  avgt    5    0.951 Â±  0.095  ms/op
Main.testCountedExecutor        50000  avgt    5    7.279 Â±  2.476  ms/op
Main.testCountedExecutor       100000  avgt    5   12.790 Â±  1.101  ms/op
Main.testCountedExecutor      1000000  avgt    5  107.034 Â±  2.076  ms/op
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As is obvious this is quite slow when compared to the Haskell case, with around
a 5x slowdown. A significant amount of the time appears to be spent on OS-level
context switches, as the smaller cases that fit into the stack of a single
thread are approximately equal to Haskell. It is hence possible that a method
that reduces the cost of context switching could make this approach feasible.</p>

<h3 id="catching-the-overflow">Catching the Overflow</h3>

<p>Though it is heavily recommended against by the Java documentation, it is indeed
possible to catch the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StackOverflowError</code>. While this provides accurate info
about when you run out of stack space, it has one major problem: you may not
unwind enough to have enough stack space to spawn a new thread.</p>

<p>The following is a potential algorithm that ignores this problem for the moment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each recursive call is wrapped in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try {} catch (StackOverflowError e) {}</code>
block in order to detect when the stack overflows.</li>
  <li>All side-effecting operations must take place within a single Java frame.</li>
  <li>When the stack overflows, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StackOverflowError</code> is thrown at frame creation.</li>
  <li>This can be caught, with control-flow entering the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">catch</code> block.</li>
  <li>A new thread is spawned to continue the computation.</li>
</ol>

<p>This works because the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StackOverflowError</code> is thrown when the attempt to create
the new stack frame is made. This means that in the failure case none of the
function body has executed so we can safely resume on a new thread.</p>

<p>The main issue with this design is ensuring that there is enough stack space
after the unwind to the catch block. If there isnât enough, then it proves
impossible to spawn a new thread and this doesnât work.</p>

<p>The benchmarks listed here implement this algorithm without actually performing
any significant computation.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Benchmark            (inputSize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units
Main.testSOExecutor          100  avgt    5   â 10â»â´           ms/op
Main.testSOExecutor         1000  avgt    5    0.003 Â±  0.001  ms/op
Main.testSOExecutor        10000  avgt    5    0.031 Â±  0.001  ms/op
Main.testSOExecutor        50000  avgt    5    3.927 Â±  0.477  ms/op
Main.testSOExecutor       100000  avgt    5    7.724 Â±  0.239  ms/op
Main.testSOExecutor      1000000  avgt    5  104.719 Â± 11.411  ms/op
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This performs slightly better than the conservative option discussed above. As
weâre guaranteed total utilisation of the stack of each thread we spawn less
threads and hence reduce the context switching overhead. Nevertheless, this is
still very slow compared to Haskell baseline.</p>

<h3 id="thread-pools">Thread Pools</h3>

<p>While a thread pool is conventionally seen as a way to amortise the cost of
spawning threads, this approach to recursion requires far more threads than is
really feasible to keep around in a pool, so weâve not explored that approach.</p>

<h3 id="project-loom">Project Loom</h3>

<p>If project loomâs coroutines and / or fibres were stable, these would likely
help somewhat by reducing the thread creation overhead that is primarily down to
OS-level context switches.</p>

<p>However, Loom doesnât currently seem like a viable solution to this approach as
it is not only far from stable, but also has no guarantee that it will actually
make it into the JVM.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-stack-usage-via-a-cps-transform">Avoiding Stack Usage via a CPS Transform</h2>

<p>Transforming recursive calls into CPS allows us to avoid the <em>need</em> for using
the stack instead of trying to augment it. This could be implemented as a global
transformation, or as a local one only for recursive calls.</p>

<p>The CPS-based approach is very much a trade-off. The code that is actually being
executed is more complex, showing an order of magnitude slowdown in the cases
where the execution profile fits into a single stack. However, once the input
size grows to the point that additional stack segments are needed, the execution
performance is within spitting distance of the Haskell code.</p>

<h3 id="the-cps-transform">The CPS Transform</h3>

<p>While it is tempting to perform the CPS transform globally for the whole
program, this has some major drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As shown above, the code becomes an order of magnitude slower within the space
of a single stack.</li>
  <li>It may be difficult to maintain a mapping from the original code to the CPSâd
execution. This would greatly impact our ability to use the debugging and
introspection tools which are necessary for implementing Enso Studio.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, an ideal design would involve only performing the CPS
transformation on code which is <em>actually</em> recursive. While you can detect this
statically via whole-program analysis, you can also track execution on the
program stack in a thread-safe manner and perform the transformation at runtime
(e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">private static ThreadLocal&lt;Boolean&gt; isExecuting;</code>).</p>

<h3 id="a-hybrid-approach">A Hybrid Approach</h3>

<p>As we clearly donât want to CPS transform the program globally, we need some
mechanism by which we can rewrite only when necessary. As discussed above, we
could do this via a dynamic runtime analysis, but we could also potentially make
use of the Java stack at least in part.</p>

<p>The hybrid approach works as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Execute the code using standard recursion on the Java stack until we catch a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StackOverflowError</code>.</li>
  <li>Spawn a new thread to rewrite the original code to CPS, and then continue
execution in that style.</li>
</ol>

<p>This avoids the CPS overhead as much as possible (when the computation fits into
the Java stack), but allows for unbounded recursion in the general case. The
performance profile is as follows.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Benchmark        (inputSize)  Mode  Cnt   Score    Error  Units
Main.testHybrid          100  avgt    5  â 10â»â´           ms/op
Main.testHybrid         1000  avgt    5   0.003 Â±  0.001  ms/op
Main.testHybrid        10000  avgt    5   0.013 Â±  0.003  ms/op
Main.testHybrid        50000  avgt    5   0.069 Â±  0.013  ms/op
Main.testHybrid       100000  avgt    5   1.765 Â±  0.056  ms/op
Main.testHybrid      1000000  avgt    5  25.961 Â±  2.775  ms/op
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This hybrid implementation makes things faster overall, with some particularly
good performance wins for the smaller cases.</p>

<p>An open question for this is how you work out exactly <em>what</em> code to CPS
transform at the point of the stack overflow. In the simply-recursive case this
is trivial, but it may require some more sophisticated tracing in the case of
mutually-recursive functions.</p>

<h2 id="linearised-representations">Linearised Representations</h2>

<p>While not something that we could feasibly do at the moment, one of the
potential solutions for this is to statically compile the language to a
linearised representation. Rather than trying to implement the CPS transform in
a Truffle interpreter not designed for it, we could instead compile Enso to a
low-level IR format which has no stack frames, and instead just uses jumps.</p>

<p>Whether we write this IR ourselves or use an existing one implemented as a
Truffle language, such as WASM bytecode (currently very experimental) or LLVM IR
(much more tried and tested), this would provide a number of benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The IR output by the compiler phase need not be fed into the truffle
interpreter for said IR.</li>
  <li>We gain more flexibility.</li>
  <li>We can still support interoperation with foreign languages through Truffle.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, such an approach also has some major downsides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We do not have the time to pursue such an approach in the short term.</li>
  <li>Such an approach would require significantly more work, as generating linear
IR representations is not as simple as generating a high-level truffle node
IR.</li>
  <li>Such an approach adds quite a lot of complexity to the compiler pipeline,
which, is currently tied quite strongly into the Truffle language life-cycle.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

<p>At the current time there are no apparent alternatives to the three approaches
discussed above. While it would be ideal for the JVM to have native support for
stack segmentation on the heap, this would likely be an in-depth and significant
amount of work to add, with no guarantee that it would be accepted into main.</p>

<h2 id="open-questions">Open Questions</h2>

<p>The following are questions for which we donât yet have answers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are there any ways to instrument a JVM thread to detect when itâs about to
stack overflow?</li>
  <li>Based on our investigation, what would your recommendation be for us to
proceed?</li>
</ul>
